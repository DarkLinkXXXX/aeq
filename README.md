The aeq Programming Language
============================

What is aeq ?
-------------

aeq is a simple interactive and interpreted language.

aeq have one language feature, variables!

In aeq there is one type a 64-bit float.

How it looks and feels ?
------------------------

aeq only works with number, it is more an interactive calculator then a language.

> x = 5 * 3.5
> 
> z = x + 6
> 
> y = z*(x+1/5000)

What technology aeq uses ?
--------------------------

aeq is written in the [Rust Programming Language](http://www.rust-lang.org/).

Thanks to Mozilla and the Rust Community for such a nice language.

What plans I have for the future ?
----------------------------------

__I want to make aeq an interactive *playground* for mathematicians.__

* Math functions like: _f(x) = x*x_.
* Interactive function plotter.

Remember
========

As a 18 years old student in Germany I cant work full time on it!

Its a fun project, no more, no less.
