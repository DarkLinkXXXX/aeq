The aeq Programming Language
============================

What is aeq ?
-------------

aeq is a simple, interactive, and interpreted language.

aeq has one language feature: variables!

In aeq there is one type: a 64-bit float.

How does it look and feel?
------------------------

aeq only works with numbers. It is more of an interactive calculator then a language.

> x = 5 * 3.5
> 
> z = x + 6
> 
> y = z*(x+1/5000)

What technology does aeq use?
--------------------------

aeq is written in the [Rust Programming Language](http://www.rust-lang.org/).

Thanks to Mozilla and the Rust Community for such a nice language.

What plans have I for the future ?
----------------------------------

__I want to make aeq an interactive *playground* for mathematicians.__

* Math functions like: _f(x) = x*x_.
* Interactive function plotter.

Remember
========

As an 18 year old student in Germany, I can not work full time on it!

Its a fun project. No more, no less.
